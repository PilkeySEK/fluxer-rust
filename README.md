A collection of crates for interacting with the Fluxer API and gateway. The crate which most bot creators will be interested in is `fluxer-neptunium` (which is a bot framework). Heavily inspired by [twilight-rs](https://github.com/twilight-rs/twilight).

Fluxer-neptunium supports user-bots too! Enable the `user_api` feature and look at the `user-bot` example to see how to let fluxer-neptunium know that your token is a user token. User bots are allowed on Fluxer as long as they don't spam.

**This is a work-in-progress! Check [#Coverage](#coverage).**

The `fluxer-api` crate has been moved to [PilkeySEK/fluxer-api](https://github.com/PilkeySEK/fluxer-api)!

# Usage
Add the `fluxer-neptunium` crate (**NOTE:** Not yet published to crates.io, as it is not production ready yet) and `tokio`. Check out the examples for examples on how to use the crate. 
If you require even more fine-grained control over things, you may be interested in the `neptunium-gateway` and/or `neptunium-http` crates.

# Examples
Examples can be found in the [examples/](./examples) directory, with a .png for some examples to show what they do.

Run an example using `FLUXER_TOKEN="<token>" cargo run --example <example>`, replacing `<token>` with the bot token and `<example>` with the example name. To run the replying-to-ping example, use `FLUXER_TOKEN="<token>" cargo run --example replying-to-ping`.

To run the `user-bot` example, you need to specify `FLUXER_USER_TOKEN` instead.

# Coverage
Note that many of the APIs are user-only, so not interesting for bots. While this crate aims to support everything in the API eventually, it is mainly intended to be used for bots, which is why the bot-usable APIs are prioritized.
- **Gateway:**
  - **Bot Gateway:** 100% (make an issue if something is missing)
  - **User Gateway:** 100% (afaik)
- **HTTP API:**
  - **Bot-relevant API:** 100%
  - **User-bot-relevant API:** >50% (probably)

This is the current support for different APIs (Categories named after [The official Fluxer API documentation sections](https://docs.fluxer.app/api-reference/instance/get-instance-discovery-document)):

# Woah new stuff
So, basically, while trying to cover parts of the API, I am sometimes discovering not yet documented features. Most of them are just not *documented*, but actually do exist in the fluxer code, which is fine. But, some others, like the GUILD_AUDIT_LOG_ENTRY_CREATE (related structs in `model/src/guild/audit_log`) dispatch event are not even in the fluxer codebase yet and instead only in the private `fluxer-v2` repository which is only available to Fluxer visionaries. I'm sadly not a visionary, so I don't fully know the structure of this event. I'm still including it for the future, but you shouldn't rely on it currently.

# Third party code
I have copied certain audit log schemas from twilight-rs, along with using `twilight-http-ratelimiting` for the rate limiting (currently `twilight-http-ratelimiting` is a modified version directly in `neptunium-http` until the next version releases which will fix a wrong debug assertion).
